### Hola, bienvenido ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! Look on your nine, you see my name and avatar? Okay.
If not, I can help you with the name but not the avatar. I'm Caleb.
I'm a software developer and a professional visual artist based in..._bleep_.

I love to mix my art skills into my designs, leveraging relevant creative concepts for designing systems and software that stirs up human use and save the day. I connect well with people of common interest and break rocks when there's teamwork.

I'm a fan of open source software, writing client libraries in JavaScript and code on the server side with NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime. Other than JavaScript, you can see me write applications in Python too.

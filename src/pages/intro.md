Pleased to meet ya!

Hi, I'm Caleb. I'm a software developer and an artist based in Nigeria, Africa.

I love to mix my art skills into my designs, leveraging relevant creative concepts for designing systems
and software that stirs up human use and save the day. I connect well with people of common interest and
break rocks when there's teamwork.

I'm a fan of open source software, writing client libraries in JavaScript and code on the server side with
Node.js. Other than JavaScript, you can see me write applications in Python too.

Pleased to meet ya!

Hey, I'm Caleb.

I'm a full stack software engineer, but other than that—amongst many other things—I'm an artist too. I hail from Nigeria and I'm African by blood and bond.

I enjoy blending my creative skills with my designs constantly tweaking things to make them better than they were the day
before, leveraging the power of my imaginative mind and proven engineering design principles for designing resilient systems and software.

I'm a fan of Open Source Software, writing client libraries in JavaScript and code on the server side with
Node.js. Other than JavaScript, you can see me write applications Java and Python too.

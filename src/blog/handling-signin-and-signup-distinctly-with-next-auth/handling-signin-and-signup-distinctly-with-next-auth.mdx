[TL;DR](#3-using-good-ol-cookies)  
[TFL;DR](#into-the-mire)

Authentication, authorization, access control, and any other synonymous name you can think to call
it, is not always a walk in the park. Through the evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW) and web
applications, there have been various solutions to help make authentication a breeze. There have
been, third-party services like [Auth0][auth0] that you can easily integrate with your apps without
having to worry much about authentication and doing it right, or worry about security because these
third-party services cover all of that. There have also been standards, and specifications like
[OAuth][oauth2] and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)][open-id] which have evolved over the years. Some
libraries and SDKs enable developers to easily integrate with these services, standards and
specifications without worrying much about low-level implementation details. The only need-to-know
is a subset of the SDK's APIs needed to meet the application requirements. [NextAuth.js][next-auth]
is one of these libraries!

</Blockquote>

NextAuth.js is a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It is
designed from the ground up to support Next.js and Serverless.
[https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction).
This library makes integrating with several OAuth 2.0 providers, like Google, Apple, Facebook,
Twitter (X), etc, a breeze.

## So what's the problem?

The problem is that I searched every nook and cranny in this library for a `signUp` function just
like there's a `signIn` function and a `signOut` function, but I couldn't find a single one.

It's expected that every application that has a way to sign in, should have a way to sign up.
Sometimes, the sign-up flow isn't always obvious, especially when working with internal applications
where there's a central admin that manages user's accounts. The admin mostly creates the account
(sign up), and gives the user the credentials, while also prompting them to change their password on
their first sign-in.

> So why is there no `signUp` function?

> Because the `signUp` function is an [easter egg][easter-egg] and no one has found it yet!

## A high-level view of the OAuth 2.0 flow

Well it's thought that when a user follows the OAuth flow, say, using one of the providers like
Google, they start with clicking a button that probably says, "Sign in with Google", then get
redirected to a Google accounts page where they are required to sign in to their Google account or,
if they are already signed in, they see a list of their signed-in accounts and choose one of them,
then get redirected back to the originating page&mdash;at least that's what the user sees.

What happens when this user doesn't have an existing account on the first-party app matching the
returned email from Google, are we supposed to tell them "Account not found" or go ahead and
implicitly create an account for them on our (first-party) app?

<p>
  It would seem the latter is the case when using NextAuth.js: if there's no account found by the
  returned email address from Google, sign up the user immediately without wasting time because we
  need to convert, and that's a plus one <abbr title="Daily Active Users">DAU</abbr> or&nbsp;
  <abbr title="Monthly Active Users">MAU</abbr> or whatnot.
</p>

This is a bad UX!

## Why I think this is a bad UX

Oftentimes I come back to an application after not using it for a while or after not having to sign
in for a while because I had a very long session before I was eventually logged out, and I can't
remember how exactly I created an account, whether I used regular email and password credentials,
"Sign in with Google", "Sign in with Apple", etc. I can't remember.

I go ahead and guess the authentication method I used, I decide it was "Sign in with Google". So I
click the "Sign in with Google" button and choose one of my Google accounts. But, whoops, it wasn't
Google&mdash;a new account has, inadvertently, been created for me on the same app.

> How did I know it's a new account?
>
> Are you really asking :(

So I try again, just this time, with more certainty that my original account is using "Sign in with
Apple". Thankfully, it sure is. What am I to do with the new account I just created?

I [mentioned this][mentioned-this] in [an age-old discussion][no-sign-up-discussion] on NextAuth
GitHub repo.

## Figuring a way out of this bad UX

We should understand the NextAuth.js flow for OAuth 2.0 flow. There's [an illustration on this
linked page][next-auth-oauth-flow] that lays out the flow.

In a nutshell, it goes to our `/api/auth/signin/[provider]` route handler first, then redirects to
that specific provider page for you to complete the authentication, the provider then redirects to
our `/api/auth/callback/[provider]` handler with some extra params about the authentication.

### 1. Using `SignInOptions`

First, I thought there should be a way to pass some custom options to the `signIn` function that
would be accessible from the [callbacks][next-auth-callbacks], since the callbacks is where you do
all the nifty tricks needed by your application.

```tsx:title=SignUpPage.tsx
signIn('google', { intent: 'signup' })
```

That was a dumb one! Calling that function with a provider other than `"credentials"` or `"email"`
will redirect to the external provider. It doesn't immediately trigger any callback or a function
like `authorize`, as in [CredentialsProvider][next-auth-credentials-provider], defined in our
`nextAuthOptions` object. By the time the two-way redirect is complete, our initial context is lost.

### 2. Using the `referer` header

Another solution I thought of was to intercept the Next.js route handler ([Next.js 13 route
handler][nextjs-13-route-handler] in my case) before passing the request to the NextAuth factory
function and read the headers to check for the `referer` header. If it matches the route of my
sign-up page then it's a sign-up the user intends, otherwise, it's a sign-in that the user intends.

```ts:title=./api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import { headers } from 'next/headers'

// assuming a `Routes` object that contains an enumeration of all or most routes in our app
// assuming some arbitrary `getAuthOptions` factory function returning the NextAuth config options

type AuthIntent = 'signin' | 'signup' // signin or signup

const Routes = { SIGNUP: '/auth/signup', ..., };

function getAuthOptions(intent: AuthIntent) {...}

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const headersList = headers()
  const referer: string | null = headersList.get('referer') // https://hostname.tld/auth/signin
  const intent = referer && new URL(referer).pathname === Routes.SIGNUP ? 'signup' : 'signin'
  return await NextAuth(req, res, getAuthOptions(intent))
}

export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

This is also flawed for two reasons.

1. There's not enough control over who can set the referer header and it's not always guaranteed to
   be present so the referer header can sometimes be empty or may contain some unexpected value.
2. Remember there's a redirect to Google from our handler and from Google back to our handler. At
   the time we need the `referer` header set to one of sign-in or sign-up routes, is when our
   handler is redirected to, from Google, and obviously, Google didn't even set a `referer`, even if
   they did it wouldn't be any of our expected routes.

### 3. Using good ol' cookies

Not that I didn't think of cookies earlier, it just didn't seem like the best approach at the time.
But since I couldn't figure out anything better that works, I had cookies as my fallback. Using
cookies, we don't need to change much of what we had with the `referer` header in the route handler.

```diff-ts:title=./api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
- import { headers } from 'next/headers'
+ import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
+ import type { RequestCookie } from 'next/dist/compiled/@edge-runtime/cookies';

// assuming a `Routes` object that contains an enumeration of all or most routes in our app
// assuming some arbitrary `getAuthOptions` factory function returning the NextAuth config options

type AuthIntent = 'signin' | 'signup' // signin or signup

- const Routes = { SIGNUP: '/auth/signup', ..., };

function getAuthOptions(intent: AuthIntent) {...}

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
-  const headersList = headers()
-  const referer: string | null = headersList.get('referer') // https://hostname.tld/auth/signin
-  const intent = referer && new URL(referer).pathname === Routes.SIGNUP ? 'signup' : 'signin'
+  const cookieStore = cookies()
+  const authIntent: RequestCookie | undefined = cookieStore.get('auth-intent')
+  const intent = (authIntent?.value ?? 'signin') as AuthIntent
  return await NextAuth(req, res, getAuthOptions(intent))
}

export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

Now that we have this on the server, how, where, and when do we exactly set this cookie we are
getting here right now?

We set this cookie in the respective pages just as immediately as the page is rendered on the
client.

## Into the Mire

It's time to get our hands dirty. I've intentionally kept the code snippets short and simple rather
than writing the entire implementation. But I guess now is the time to put it all together. Yet,
I'll be omitting some stuff, like JSX for pages, and go straight to the logic needed to show you the
crux of this article, as this is not a tutorial on how to build authentication pages.

I hate to write snippets with undefined references, but this is me letting you know upfront that
there may be undefined references in this one if I think a pseudo-code is enough or the references
are such that, however you write your implementation is up to you.

> bake yours.

Our sign-up and sign-in logic will look like the following:

```tsx:title=SignUpPage.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react'

import Cookies from 'js-cookie';
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';

import { AppleButton, GoogleButton } from '@/components/buttons';
import { createAccountService } from '@/services/account';

export const SignUpForm = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    Cookies.set('auth-intent', 'signup');
    return () => Cookies.remove('auth-intent');
  }, []);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: SubmitEvent) => {
    // Handle credential flow submission here and send data to your API
    const form = new FormData(e.target); // You're probably going to use `useState` or react-hook-form
    // highlight-start
    await createAccountService({ first_name: form.get('username'), ... });
    await signIn('credentials', { email: form.get('email'), password: form.get('password') });
    // highlight-end
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSumbit}>
      <GoogleButton type="button" onClick={() => signIn('google')}>
        Sign up with Google
      </GoogleButton>

      <AppleButton type="button" onClick={() => signIn('apple')}>
        Sign up with Apple
      </AppleButton>

      {/* Other form inputs will go somewhere here */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  You may not need NextAuth.js to handle your credentials sign-up flow where users have to enter
  first name, last name, email, password, etc. For the sign-up, NextAuth.js is handling the OAuth
  flow only.
</Callout>

Looking at the highlighted lines, after setting the cookie, we have a credentials sign-in following
the call to `createAccountService` because I'm assuming `createAccountService` doesn't return a
session token, just the newly created user account object. So we have to follow up with a sign-in to
get the session tokens. If your API returns session tokens when registering a user, you may move
your user registration logic into the NextAuth.js flow (inside your auth options file, `options.ts`)
so you can add those tokens to your NextAuth.js session without having to sign in again after
registering.

You are probably thinking that the `auth-intent` cookie is set to `"signup"`, and it would affect
the call to `signIn` following it. No, it won't. The cookie is only needed by the OAuth flow but we
are using the credentials flow here. But, again, if your API for registering users returns session
tokens and you are handling your registration inside NextAuth.js, yes, this cookie may be necessary
for your credentials flow, except you choose a different method to distinguish a sign-in from a
sign-up, since you can pass data directly to your credentials provider handler using the `signIn`
function.

Soon we'll define the auth options which will contain the core logic. But first, let's talk about
the sign-in page and the sign-in form:

```tsx:title=SignInPage.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react'

import Cookies from 'js-cookie';
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';

import { AppleButton, GoogleButton } from '@/components/buttons';

export const SignInForm = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    Cookies.set('auth-intent', 'signin')
    return () => Cookies.remove('auth-intent');
  }, []);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: SubmitEvent) => {
    // Handle credential flow submission here and send data through NextAuth.js
    const form = new FormData(e.target); // You're probably going to use `useState` or react-hook-form
    // highlight-next-line
    await signIn('credentials', { email: form.get('email'), password: form.get('password') });
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSumbit}>
      <GoogleButton type="button" onClick={() => signIn('google')}>
        Sign in with Google
      </GoogleButton>

      <AppleButton type="button" onClick={() => signIn('apple')}>
        Sign in with Apple
      </AppleButton>

      {/* Other form inputs will go somewhere here */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  It's okay, in fact encouraged, to handle your credentials sign-in flow where users have to enter
  username or email, and password with NextAuth.js. For the sign-in, NextAuth.js is handling both
  the OAuth flow and the credentials flow.
</Callout>

Easy-peasy, nothing much to see here, we just had to call the sign-in function with the correct
data, and oh, yes, set our `auth-intent` cookie.

Now back to our route handler. Applying [our patch from above](#3-using-good-ol-cookies).

```ts:title=./api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

// highlight-next-line
import type { RequestCookie } from 'next/dist/compiled/@edge-runtime/cookies';

import { getAuthOptions } from './options';

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const cookieStore = cookies();
  const authIntent: RequestCookie | undefined = cookieStore.get('auth-intent');
  const intent = (authIntent?.value ?? 'signin') as AuthIntent;
  return await NextAuth(req, res, getAuthOptions(intent));
}

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```

<Callout type="info">
  The highlighted import statement above isn't necessary. It's only there for the sake of this
  article so you know `authIntent` could be either that type or `undefined`
</Callout>

We read the `auth-intent` from the request cookies to our route handler, which intercepts the
NextAuth.js route handler, and pass it as an argument to the `getAuthOptions` factory function.

We should talk about the `getAuthOptions` factory function which we define in our `options.ts` file.
For our `options.ts` file, we'll write it chunk by chunk because it's quite long. We start with
defining some imports. It is assumed that we have some service functions that we can use to send a
request to our API on the backend:

- The `authenticateAccountService` is a service used to authenticate a user using the credentials
  flow, i.e., email, and password.
- The `authenticateAccountOIDCService` is used to authenticate a user using an OAuth with OpenID
  Connect flow, i.e., access_token, and id_token (for Google).
- The `createAccountOIDCService` is used to create a user using an OAuth with OpenID Connect flow,
  i.e., access_token, and id_token (for Google).
- The `identifyUserAccountService` is used to fetch the user object provided that an access token
  granted by our application is present.

```typescript:title=options.ts {numberLines: true}
import { AuthOptions, DefaultSession, Session } from 'next-auth';
import { JWT } from 'next-auth/jwt';
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google';
import { BuiltInProviderType } from 'next-auth/providers/index';

import { authenticateAccountService, authenticateAccountOIDCService } from '@/services/account';
import { createAccountOIDCService, identifyUserAccountService } from '@/services/account';
import { type SigninCredentials, type UserAccountResponse } from '@/services/account';
```

Let's take a short break from the `options.ts` file. We are going to do some [declaration
merging][declaration-merging] to make sure the shape of NextAuth.js objects fits our needs. [A
guide][next-auth-typescript-guide] is also available in the NextAuth.js documentation.

```ts:title=types.ts
import { DefaultSession } from 'next-auth';

export interface AppToken {
  id: string // user account id
  type: string // Bearer
  access_token: string
  refresh_token: string
}

export interface AppSessionUser extends NonNullable<DefaultSession['user']> {
  /** @note This is the user account ID generated by the application itself not `providerAccountId` */
  id?: string;
  /** @note This is the token generated by the application itself not any 3rd party */
  tokens?: AppToken;
}
```

```ts:title=@types/next-auth.d.ts
import { AppSessionUser, AppToken } from './types';

declare module 'next-auth' {
  /** Returned by `useSession`, `getSession`, and `getServerSession` */
  interface Session {
    user: AppSessionUser;
    tokens?: AppToken;
  }

  interface User {
    /** Only present when using credentials provider */
    tokens?: AppToken;
  }
}

declare module 'next-auth/jwt' {
  interface JWT {
    tokens?: AppToken;
  }
}
```

Back to our `options.ts` file. We are going to define some utility functions and an enum of
supported providers.

```typescript:title=options.ts {numberLines: 10}
export enum AccountProviderEnum {
  GOOGLE = 'google',
  APPLE = 'apple',
}

export const never = (_: never) => {
  throw new Error('Unimplemented')
}

export const getAuthorization = (token: AppToken | null) =>
  token ? `${token.type} ${token.access_token}` : undefined
```

We should define our credentials provider handler used in the `authorize` method. This function
authenticates a user using their email, and password credentials, and uses the resulting token to
get the user's identity by calling another function with it that returns the user account object. A
subset of the data from the user account object is returned from this function:

```typescript:title=options.ts {numberLines: 21}
const authorizeHandler = async (credentials: SignInCredentials, _req: any) => {
  const { data: token } = await authenticateAccountService(credentials)
  const { data: identity } = await identifyUserAccountService({
    headers: { Authorization: getAuthorization(token) },
  })

  const account = identity.data

  // The returned value here becomes the user object in the `jwt` callback args (`params.user`)
  // The `id` in this returned object is used to add a `sub` property to token (`params.token`)
  return {
    id: account.id,
    email: account.email,
    name: account.user.fullname,
    image: account.avatar,
    tokens: token,
  }
}
```

Next is our `jwt` callback, which gets called after a successful round trip&mdash;a two-way redirect
to and from the OAuth provider&mdash;or after our `authorize` function in the credentials provider
returns. We'll further split this `jwt` callback into a couple independent functions. We are
handling just two things, or more technically "triggers", in our `jwt` callback: the `"signIn"`
trigger and the `"update"` trigger. Our `signIn` trigger handles three things, which are the
`"credentials"`, `"google"`, and `"apple"` providers, but I'll only be talking about the
`"credentials"` and `"google"` providers.

```typescript:title=options.ts {numberLines: 39}
type JWTCallback = NonNullable<AuthOptions['callbacks']>['jwt'];
type Params = Parameters<JWTCallback>[0];
type Account = Params['account'];

const googleHandler = async (account: Account, jwt: JWT, intent: AuthIntent) => {
  let identity: UserAccountResponse | undefined = undefined;

  if (!account.access_token || !account.id_token) {
    throw new Error(`Access token and ID token are missing in the ${provider} provider`);
  }

  // You'll send this to your API where you verify the tokens, and get the user info
  // to register them with, from Google's tokeninfo endpoint
  const credentials = {
    access_token: account.access_token,
    id_token: account.id_token,
    provider: AccountProviderEnum.GOOGLE,
  };

  // The intent passed to this factory function as received from the request cookies
  switch (intent) {
    case 'signin':
      break; // noop
    case 'signup':
      ({ data: identity } = await createAccountOIDCService(credentials));
      break;
    default:
      never(intent);
  }

  // After registration we'll still authenticate (signin) anyway.
  // So "signin" case above is a no-op
  const res = await authenticateAccountOIDCService(credentials)
  const token = res.data

  // identity will be undefined for intent="signin" but will
  // be of type UserAccountResponse if "signup"
  if (!identity) {
    ({ data: identity } = await identifyUserAccountService({
      headers: { Authorization: getAuthorization(token) },
    }));
  }

  // Make sure you update the `sub` property of the token (jwt is params.token)
  // to use the ID given to the user by your application rather than the provider
  // account ID which is the user's Google account ID in this case
  return { ...jwt, tokens: token, sub: identity.data.user.id };
};
```

Since, I believe, our OAuth scope for Google is `user.profile user.email openid`, we get both an
`access_token` and an `id_token`. We send these tokens with the name of the provider that granted
them (google) to our backend where the tokens are verified and the user information is retrieved
using [Google's tokeninfo endpoint][google-tokeninfo-endpoint] in this case.

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure to check the `aud` field of both the access and id tokens. Check that it matches your
  `GOOGLE_ID` (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`).
</Callout>

When the `intent` we retrieved from the request cookies is `signup`, we create an account for the
user using their credentials. Notice that in the case of `signin` it's a no-op, because whatever
applies to the `signin` case here also applies to the `signup` case, and we don't want to repeat
ourself, so we just wait to do it after the switch-case statement&mdash;we authenticate the user
either ways to get their session tokens and add these tokens to the returned object, which is
further used down the callbacks pipeline in making the eventual NextAuth.js session and also
serialized to make the NextAuth.js JWT token, since we are not using a [database
strategy][next-auth-database-strategy].

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to override the existing `sub` field in the `params.token` from the original callback
  which is passed into our function as `jwt` with the user ID generated by your application as the
  default is the user's Google account ID.
</Callout>

```typescript:title=options.ts {numberLines: 87}
const signInTrigger = async (params: Params, jwt: JWT, intent: AuthIntent) => {
  const account = params.account!; // account is available when the trigger is "signIn"
  const provider = account.provider as BuiltInProviderType;
  const user = params.user; // user is available when the trigger is "signIn"

  switch (provider) {
    case 'credentials': {
      // The application-provided token returned from the authorize method in the credentials provider
      return { ...jwt, tokens: user.tokens };
    }
    case 'google': {
      return await googleHandler(account, jwt, intent);
    }
    default:
      // Our app only supports Google and Apple, although I'm skipping "apple" here
      never(provider as never)
      return jwt; // unreachable but typescript won't know
  }
}
```

The `signInTrigger` function is simple enough. Switch between providers for as many as are
supported. The return statement in the default case is not necessary since `never` throws an error,
but TypeScript can't see that. The return statement prevents our return signature from being unioned
with `undefined`

Whew, finally we arrive at our `getAuthOptions` function! We will go ahead now and define our
`getAuthOptions` factory function.

```typescript:title=options.ts {numberLines: 106}
export const getAuthOptions: (intent: AuthIntent) => AuthOptions = (intent) => {
  return {
    pages: { signIn: Routes.SIGNIN, newUser: Routes.HOME },
    providers: [
      GoogleProvider({ clientId: GOOGLE_ID, clientSecret: GOOGLE_SECRET }),
      CredentialsProvider({
        credentials: {
          email: { label: 'Email address', type: 'email' },
          password: { label: 'Password', type: 'Password' },
        },
        async authorize(credentials: SignInCredentials | undefined, req) {
          if (!credentials) return null;
          return await authorizeHandler(credentials, req)
        },
      }),
    ],
    callbacks: {
      async jwt(params) {
        const jwt = params.token;
        if (params.trigger === 'signIn') {
          Object.assign(jwt, await signInTrigger(params, jwt, intent));
        } else if (params.trigger === 'update') {
          // TODO: validate params.session
          const update: Session = params.session;

          // When you update your session by refreshing your application tokens, for example.
          Object.assign<JWT, JWT>(jwt, {
            tokens: update.tokens,
            email: update.user.email,

        // We can access those mutated fields here and compose them to make our session object.
        params.session.user.id = params.token.sub;
        params.session.tokens = params.token.tokens;

        // This is the eventual session object we get when using `useSession` or `getServerSession`

No more explaining. Go figure!

Ah, meh, that was a long one! Sh\*t got too real that I forgot to make even more jokes. But can't

I'm so glad to announce that my blog has finally landed and is live. Ha ha! Needs no announcement, you see it!
It's really been a journey finally coming to own a blog and be a lord of my own on the internet rather than a tenant. Just as owning something of yours feels, the liberty, the freedom, being the master, therefore I dictate my own rules and I make things look and feel the way I want them. The feeling is never different, but I relish having the feeling when I can.

Oh! Let me clear this. I titled this post "Building My Second Gatsby Blog", yet I claim that I just became "a lord of my own on the internet". I am not a technophobe of some sort, I've long used the internet as it lived or as I lived (if probably the internet lived before me). Since I said "Building My Second Gatsby Blog" which means this isn't my first. It's the first I ever built for myself since I landed in the tech niche / industry. I once had one on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), I used to write on [Medium](https://medium.com) and I actively write on [Dev](https://dev.to). But what has all those made me? **A tenant**.

The time to commit to doing it earlier was a commodity out of stock for me.
Now I'm happy to say: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my housewarming. Should I have said blogwarming? Oh, who'd had thought domainwarming sounds cool! This is my domain and I mean it in every way possible, DNS-wise and literally.

## Let's cut the crap

Secret is out! I built this blog with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) and damnnnn Gatsby is dope! I knew since my first time using Gatsby that it was dope, but the feeling is on a whole new level this time. Although I hate doing one thing twice except for some good reason. I initially wanted [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), but then I thought if I wanted to get up to speed, I'd better used Gatsby.

### What's involved?

Well, nothing quite much. Nothing more than you'd expect. As we all know, Gatsby is another extra layer on top of [React](https://reactjs.org) that takes the full advantage of React, GraphQL and Nodejs to function as an SSG.

- Built with Gatsby
- Coded with React in Javascript
- Styled with CSS / SCSS
- Themeing done with CSS custom properties
- Content writing done with Markdown and MDX
- Source management with Git on [Github](https://github.com/calebpitan/calebpitan)
- Deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
- Serverless with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
- Running in your browser

I felt like doing something a little differently so I ditched Styled Components for SCSS. For the serverless, I wanted something which I could have more control over and that's definitely not Netlify Functions, which itself is an abstraction around AWS Lambda to make it a _one-click_ setup, so I went with Firebase since I'm familiar with it too. Netlify Functions is beautiful, easy setup and no complexities, yeah, I use it in some other projects &mdash; different projects require different stacks.

## The purpose of this blog

There is a purpose for this blog and without it I shouldn't be here. I hope to reach out and connect with more people through this medium. I want to actively contribute to the developer community, by sharing what I know, doing some _stunts_, creating tutorials and talk about what I do, every step I take, in my journey through the industry and share my progress with projects and also talk about my products as I make them.

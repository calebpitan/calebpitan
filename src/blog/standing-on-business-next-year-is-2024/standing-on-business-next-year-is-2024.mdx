  Time and time again, a year passes and another comes. 
  But what exactly is a year? Can you touch it, breathe it, see it?

Time. Time is a very fundamental unit of existence. Every move, even as small as a finger twitch, we
ever make is encoded into an illusory unit of time. Although time doesn't exist, one thing exists to
make up for the illusion of time&mdash;memories.

Memories have a way of alluding to time. The longer we live, the richer we become in the "quantity"
of memories we've "accrued", but the poorer we get in the quality of these memories. Hence, the need
to capture memories in one form or the other. These days we prefer to leave a digital footprint.
Taking photographs, cameos, snaps, recording music, podcasts, vlogs, even blogging, are common ways
of saving and sharing memorable experiences. In the years before recent times, keeping diaries,
journals, memoirs, paintings, and souvenirs, were some ways of proxying to the _cause_ of time.

Yes, time is an effect of memory! Consequently, that makes memory the cause of time. Maybe time is
that Tachyon particle we've been looking for, and that is why it has eluded us. But that would
depend what it is you think you acquired first. Memory or time?

Do you need time to build memories or do you need memories to perceive time? I think space is what
you acquired first&mdash;another fundamental unit of existence, a combination of which makes
spacetime&mdash;but to find what comes next you need to solve the paradox. I'll present you with
another paradox:

Change is an effect of time! That suggests that time causes change. Gradually, we all age. Change in
velocity doesn't make much sense without relating it to time. A radioactive decay has to be relative
to time. But change also causes time, doesn't it? Now you are confused because that suggests time is
also an effect of change. That change in velocity occurs simultaneously with time. If time could be
paused, nothing would change. But could time pause because nothing changes?

Hypothetically speaking, if nothing changes in the universe, not a single state of the universe
changes, not even your state of mind, wouldn't time, in fact, have paused? There's no time without
an observer. It has been established that "memories" is one way we observe time. For a moment there
you may wonder: well if something was paused to resume later then there must be an interval between
the period _T<sub>o</sub>_ it was paused and the period _T<sub>1</sub>_ it was resumed. But who or
what in the universe observed that interval? Nothing changed, not your state of mind, not even your
wristwatch, nor the clock on the London Tower. That's the whole universe sent into oblivion. Or
isn't that what it means to pause time? To have everything in the universe come to a halt. This is
proof that time is nothing but a perception of the human mind.

All I've been saying has put time in a difficult situation. How could something be a cause and an
effect at the same time? Doesn't that put time in a causal loop? Eventually, it all comes down to
two things&mdash;time and change&mdash;when you realize memory is a persistent representation of
change of events leading to a change in the state of the mind. Our memory is a part of our
consciousness which aids our perception of time.

## Definition of time

I've presented a lot of foundational concepts for too long we just might have passed time a little
too much. It's about time we gave explicans to the presented explicandum. There are multiple ways in
which I can define time, all deduced from the premise I laid out earlier. By now we've demystified
our paradoxes. Using a second paradox we were able to better understand and make useful deductions
from our first paradox:

- Time is a state of the mind.
- Time is our sanity check for tracking what point of our lives we are in.
- Time is a perception of the interval between two discrete events.
- Time is in a causal loop with change in the universe.
- Time is the rate of change of a variable _(a)_ of a body _(A)_ relative to the rate of change of a
  variable _(b)_ of another body _(B)_.

## Time-change causal loop

Change is _relative_ entropy. The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy always increases
with time. This idea reinforces a claim we made earlier in our second paradox that change occurs
simultaneously with time, by which we established that time and change are in a causal loop. The
interrelationship established between space and time in Einsteins's Special Theory of Relativity,
which adds an extra dimension to the 3D spatial dimension to give a 4D spacetime dimension. Time
lays down an extra dimension for change to occur in the spatial dimension. As change occurs, leading
to increased entropy in the spatial dimension the temporal dimension also expands and stretches far
out enough to accomodate the increased entropy.

Time travel is basically reversing the entire change of state that has occured in the universe to a
previous state at the same instant

Keep increasing the precision of time from nano to pico and down

Now can infinitely be split futher down to attain more level of precision.

change is the effect of time and change brings about memories

change needs a timeframe to happen

you have to see change which is the effect of time before you can perceive time
